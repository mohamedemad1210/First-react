Luxury Hotel Frontend
Welcome to the Luxury Hotel Frontend project. This frontend interface is designed using React.js to deliver a modern, user-friendly experience for luxury hotel websites. It features responsive design, smooth navigation, and visually appealing layouts, ensuring users can effortlessly explore rooms, amenities, and booking options across various devices.

The project employs a modular approach with reusable React components, making it scalable and easy to maintain. It also incorporates React Router for seamless navigation between pages and supports dynamic interactions through JavaScript (ES6+). If needed, Axios can be integrated for efficient API calls and data fetching.

The folder structure is well-organized, with separate directories for assets, components, pages, and global styles, ensuring clarity and easy navigation for developers.
